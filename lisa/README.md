# Plan

- Start program with:
    - Optional DIR arg (could do multiple??? idk how that would work) (use cwd as default)
    - Flags:
        - list everything   i.e. ls -a
        - recurse (with depth)
        - filter by extension(?)
    - Formatting:
        - list details      i.e. ls -l
        - colors???
        - list/tree view???
        - cute table??
    - Sorting options:
        - Size (int)
        - Creation (time)
        - Modification (time)
        - Name (alpha)
        - Owner (alpha)
        - Group (alpha)
        - Permissions(?) maybe a little harder to do
- Parse args.
- Search through directories in top level, collect files
    - if recurse flag then scan through following dirs also.
        - how to keep track of the deeper files??? maybe a dict??? dirs as keys, lists of files as vals, recursive
    - if not list everything then filter out hidden files (., .., .gitignore, .git, .vscode, etc.)
- Sort files/dirs from command args
- Print files/dirs according to formatting args
